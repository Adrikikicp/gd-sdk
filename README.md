Helium's Geometry dash modding SDK

This what's attempted to make in my [profile](https://github.com/Adrikikicp/Adrikikicp-SDK) but was harder. So i tried to make in this organization. Languages used are:
C
C++
Rust
C#
Java

## Compiling

You can compile with CMake or the SDK CLI's fork of Make. With SDK CLI is 
```sh

helium mk build
```

Java files can be builded with
```sh

./gradlew build

```

For cocos, you can get [here](https://github.com/HJFod/cocos-headers), and compile it with

```sh

helium cocos build

```

This code is for start

```cpp


#include <helium.h>

#include <cocos.h>




```
